## Getting Started

```bash
### Step 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/adu-steve/Studymate-App.git
cd studymate-academia-copilot


### Step 2: Use Node.js version 18
nvm use 18

### If you donâ€™t have Node.js 18 installed, run:
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

### Step 3: Install dependencies
npm install

```

### Step 4: Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables for Firebase and OpenAI API:

### Set the firebase variables in a .env file separately in the frontend folder.

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id

### Set the openai api key separately in the server folder as well in another .env file plus a tavily api key.

For you Tavily link = `(https://app.tavily.com)`
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
TAVILY_API_KEY= "your-tavily-api-key"

### Step 5: Start the development server for the frontend React App

cd frontend
npm start
This will run the app in development mode on `http://localhost:3000.`

### Step 6: Start the server for the backend processing as well

cd server
npm run dev
This will run the server`http://localhost:5000.`

### Step 7: Build for production

To build the app for production:
npm run build
